WHAT I DO
-----------------

### Frontend Development

From HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to Bootstrap, AngularJS, and React. Tools like NPM, Yarn, Webpack, and Gulp -- among other build tools, as well as tools such as Git, Subversion, etc. Front-end has been the bulk of my programming experience. With an extensive track-record in many of its flavors and colors; as well as a profound knowledge  of UX, and UI Design and Technical Implementation.

### Project Management

From my work in Wireless Telecom, as a PM for Nokia on multi-million-dollar contracts, managing teams of 20+ people; to the last 5 years at Carlsberg Group as Frontend Architect, and 8 years as a co-founder of Greygoo, running our Development team, External Resources around the globe, and collaborating with clients, from Architecture Design to Maintenance; I've developed serious PM chops. With a deep understanding of Agile Methodologies, Scrum and Kanban.

### JavaScript Development

Over the last decade or so, I've found myself obsessed with JavaScript's simplicity, extensiveness, and polymorphic nature. Learning about its Design Patterns, compilers like Babel, and staying on top of its evolution. Lately that has lead me on to a Vanilla JS quest, ES6, and TypeScript.

### Mobile Development

At Greygoo I got to get some real world, hand-on experience with a wide variety of platforms, like React Native, Ionic, AppGyver, and PhoneGap. Additionally, I got to Manage the Development of numerous Native apps, in both Objectve-C, and Java -- for iOS and Android.
